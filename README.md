## What Are Fortnite Skins?

In Fortnite, skins are cosmetic items that allow you to customize your character’s appearance in the game. These skins don’t affect gameplay or provide any competitive advantages, but they help personalize your gaming experience. Fortnite skins range from basic designs to elaborate, rare outfits that feature unique styles, animations, and emotes. Skins are a huge part of Fortnite’s appeal and have a massive impact on the game’s vibrant community and marketplace.

### Types of Fortnite Skins

Fortnite skins come in various types, each offering something different to the player. Here are some of the main categories of skins you can expect to find:

- **Common Skins**: These are basic and often free skins that can be unlocked through various in-game events, challenges, or giveaways.
- **Uncommon Skins**: These skins have a little more detail and flair. They’re often available through the Battle Pass or specific challenges.
- **Rare Skins**: These skins are harder to get and usually require the purchase of a Battle Pass or the completion of special events.
- **Epic Skins**: Epic skins are premium skins with high levels of detail and exclusive designs, often tied to limited-time events or collaborations.
- **Legendary Skins**: These are the most prestigious skins in Fortnite, often associated with famous collaborations or exclusive in-game purchases. They stand out in terms of uniqueness, style, and complexity.
